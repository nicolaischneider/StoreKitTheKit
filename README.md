# StoreKitTheKit

StoreKit and StoreKit2 are quite frankly a mega ********* to use and caused me lots of complicatons in the past,. If you still want to avoid paying the 1% fee for RevenueCat this is the way to go!

1. Simple Setup
2. Local Storage for Offline Cases
3. Handling of switching between being online and offline
4. Currently only supporting non-consumable IAP
